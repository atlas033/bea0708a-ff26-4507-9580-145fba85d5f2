# Events App - teclead challenge
This is a website I made for an interview.

Requirements:
- Events must be sorted by date (See Design Mock). When the user scrolls down
scrolls down, the date should remain visible at the top.
- When the user clicks the "+" button, the shopping cart icon in the top right corner is updated 
and the event is removed from the list. When the user clicks on the shopping cart
there will be an overview of all events that have been added to the shopping cart.
- When the user clicks on the location, a new tab will be opened in the browser where the
Google Maps location is shown.
- If the user enters something in the search field, only events should be listed where the
search term appears in the title.
